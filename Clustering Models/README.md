# Clustering

Clustring is done to find patterns in our data. Simply put, just imagine classification but without the dependent variable and we create the dependent variables and find the clusters of data with same variables.

***NOTE*** : Since there is no dependent variable in our data we will consider all columns for independent variables. Howeever our first column is customer id which will have no affect on result so we excluded it and also, we have excluded column 2 and 3 just so we have ony two variables so we can visualize data on a 2d plot.
